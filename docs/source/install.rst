Installation Guide
==================

For optimal performance SPGL1 requires the compilation of several Mex files. 
This can be done from Matlab by running ``spgsetup`` from the SPGL1 directory.
In some cases the Mex compiler needs to be configured first. This can be done by
calling ``mex -setup`` (see `here
<https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/changing-default-compiler.html>`_ for more information).
