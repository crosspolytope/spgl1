Stopping criteria
======================================

As a numerical solver we cannot expect SPGL1 to obtain the exact solution to either the Lasso or the basis-pursuit denoise problem. This means that we need to have conditions that quantify how close the approximation should be to the exact solution. In addition, we may also want to provide limits on the computational resources used, to make sure the solver does not continue indefinitely. Together these conditions are called the stopping criteria, and we here discuss the various criteria used in SPGL1.

Recall from the Introduction that the Lasso problem is given by

.. math::

   \mathop{\mathrm{minimize}}_{x}\ {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\Vert Ax-b\Vert_2^2 + {\textstyle\frac{\mu}{2}}\Vert x\Vert_2^2\quad\mathrm{subject\ to}\quad \Vert x\Vert_p \leq \tau
